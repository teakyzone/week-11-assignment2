# Week 11 assignment

CreativeQuest
A web app that serves as an AI chatbot to generate creative briefs to encourage experimentation, exploration within creativity.

# What did i achieve?

I was able to achieve all requirements including stretch goal of adding a structured prompt relevant to my app which utilises a framework.
I added some design principles to make the content visible, this includes the rounded edge white backgrounds to the individual divs and one to the response container.
I also tried to add a pdf link which works on the GoLive function (not too sure about the live render yet but will see)

# Errors and bugs

This time i only came across a server error as I had a type error but this was easily resolved
I also came across a few syntax errors down to me confusing the fetch errors

# This is my work flow underneath:

Make a new.object from form entry from the fetch requests

Okay, here’s a detailed personal creative project brief designed to showcase your branding skills, centered around healthy eating, using the COSTAR method. I've aimed to make it encouraging and practical to help you grow your freelance creative practice. **Project Brief: Branding for Healthy Habits** **Project Name / Working Title:** "Nourish & Flourish: A Healthy Habits Branding Project" **Project Mission / Vision:** To create a compelling and holistic brand identity for a hypothetical healthy eating initiative. This project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating my ability to develop a brand that resonates with a target audience, communicates key values, and inspires positive behavioral change. This is an opportunity to demonstrate how I can translate complex concepts into visually appealing and emotionally engaging branding solutions. **COSTAR Method Breakdown:** _ **Context:** _ **Market Need:** There's a growing awareness of the importance of healthy eating but also an overwhelming amount of misinformation and confusing diets. Many existing healthy eating brands lack a clear, relatable, and accessible identity. _ **Your Position:** As a freelance creative, this project demonstrates your ability to solve this problem by crafting a brand that cuts through the noise and empowers individuals to make informed and enjoyable food choices. _ **Reflective Prompt:** _What are some of the biggest frustrations people face when trying to adopt healthier eating habits? How can branding help alleviate these frustrations?_ _ **Objective:** _ Develop a complete brand identity system, including logo design, color palette, typography, imagery style, and brand voice. _ Showcase the brand identity through mockups such as a website landing page, social media assets, and packaging design. _ Create a case study outlining the branding process, target audience research, and design rationale. * **Reflective Prompt:** *What tangible elements will clearly demonstrate the impact and effectiveness of this brand identity?\* _ **Style:** _ **Visual Style:** Clean, modern, approachable, and optimistic.

They are digitally savvy and value authenticity, transparency, and sustainability. _ **Secondary Audience:** Food bloggers, nutritionists, and wellness influencers who are looking for credible and engaging resources to share with their audience. _ **Application:** _ The brand will be applied in various contexts, including a website, social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook), and potential packaging for healthy food products or meal kits. _ **Reflective Prompt:** _What are the specific needs, desires, and pain points of the target audience? How can the branding address these needs effectively?_ _ **Response:** _ The brand should inspire trust, encourage positive behavior change, and foster a sense of community among its audience. _ It should communicate the value proposition of healthy eating in a clear and compelling way. _ **Reflective Prompt:** _What emotions or actions do you want the audience to experience when they interact with the brand?_ **Inspiration & References:** _ **Contextual/Theoretical Influences:** _ **Behavioral Economics:** Explore how principles like nudging and framing can be applied to encourage healthier eating habits. (e.g., Dan Ariely's work on Predictably Irrational) _ **Food Psychology:** Understand the psychological factors that influence food choices, such as emotional eating, sensory perception, and social influences. _ **Sustainability & Ethical Consumption:** Research the impact of food production on the environment and explore ways to promote sustainable and ethical eating practices. _ **Visual References:** _ **Brands with Strong Healthy Eating Identities:** Research brands like Thistle, Daily Harvest, or Sakara Life to analyze their branding strategies. _ **Minimalist Design:** Explore minimalist design principles to create a clean and uncluttered brand identity. _ **Nature-Inspired Imagery:** Look for inspiration in nature photography, botanical illustrations, and organic textures. **Creative Approach / Voice:** _ Emphasize simplicity, clarity, and authenticity. _ Use storytelling to connect with the audience on an emotional level. _ Incorporate elements of humor and playfulness to make healthy eating more approachable. _ Avoid jargon and overly technical language. **Scope & Constraints:** _ **Timeframe:** 1 week _ **Budget:** This is a personal project, so budget is time and effort.
